##What's Countly?

[Countly](http://count.ly) is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics and push notifications platform. It collects data from mobile devices, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application 
usage and end-user behavior. There are two parts of Countly: [the server that collects and analyzes data](http://github.com/countly/countly-server), and mobile SDK that sends this data. Both parts are open source with different licensing terms.

##Unity SDK features

This repository includes the Countly Unity3D SDK. It has support for the following: 

* Complete analytics
* Push notifications for GCM (Android)
* Push notifications for APNS-- untested
* Crash reporting
* Referral tracking (Enterprise Edition) 
* User profiles (Enterprise Edition)

Documentation on setting up Unity SDK, sending custom events, sending crash reports and data about User Profiles [can be found in Countly Resources page](http://resources.count.ly/docs/countly-sdk-for-unity).
